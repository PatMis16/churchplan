# churchplan
churchplan is a project to create an application to manage church resources and events. This project is mainly focuses at districts and congretations of the New Apostolic Church.

A district consists out of multiple congregations. There are ministers on district and congregation level. There are different functions, so called services, which are performed by brothers and sisters from congregations at both the district and congregational levels. Ministries and functions are to be mapped as roles and role-based access contol is to be implemented.

The app must provide to manage different schedules on district an congregation level. Ministers and services must be able to be assigned to the various schedules. This sould be possible by either direct assignement or by invitation. There must also be a way for the ministers and services to enter absences. There needs to be a view that allows the appropriate roles to schedule worship services and assign available ministers at the district and congregational level.

There also needs to be the ability to publish schedules at both the district and municipal levels. This schedules must be available through an API to enable the integration in existing websites for districts and congregations.
